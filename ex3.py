# Study Drills
# 1. Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.

# 2. Remember in Exercise 0 when you started python3.6? Start python3.6 this way again and, using the math operators, use Python as a calculator.

# 3. Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.

# 4.  Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so itâ€™s more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.
