# Study Drills
# variable 'car_pool_capacity' in line 8 does not match the name 'carpool_capacity' in line 7

# 1. I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it's just 4?
# Not necessary, spaces are whole numbers.
# Variable carpool_capacity would be a whole number

# 2. Remember that 4.0 is a floating point number. Itâ€™s just a number with a decimal point, and you need 4.0 instead of just 4 so that it is floating point.

# 3. Write comments above each of the variable assignments.

# 4. Make sure you know what = is called (equals) and that its purpose is to give data (numbers, strings, etc.) names (cars_driven, passengers).

# 5. Remember that _ is an underscore character.

# 6. Try running python3.6 from the Terminal as a calculator like you did before, and use variable names to do your calculations. Popular variable names include i, x, and j.
