# Study Drills
# 1. Go online and find out what Python's input does.
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input
# '...reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that'

# 2. Can you find other ways to use it? Try some of the samples you find.
s = input('--> ')
print(s)

# 3. Write another "form" like this to ask some other questions.
print("What's your first name?", end= ' ')
print("Where do you live?", end=' ')
print("What's your job?", end=' ')
