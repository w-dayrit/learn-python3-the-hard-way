# Study Drills
# 1. What do you think the if does to the code under it?
# Executes code if condition is met

# 2. Why does the code under the if need to be indented four spaces?
# Designate that it belongs to the if condition

# 3. What happens if it isnâ€™t indented?
# Will just run without checking the if condition

# 4. Can you put other Boolean expressions from Exercise 27 in the if-statement? Try it.
# Yes

# 5. What happens if you change the initial values for people, cats, and dogs?
# Changes outcomes of the conditions
